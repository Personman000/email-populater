I appreciate that you have publicly shown support for Palestine in the past and I urge you to do more.
While I appreciate that you’ve signed a pledge to oppose Israel’s illegal annexations, Canada must do more. Israel continues to illegally attack innocent Palestinian civilians, and we as Canadians have a moral obligation to assist in any way we can. I implore you to take further action to rectify the violation of Palestinian human rights. 
I know that you’ve made a statement expressing disapproval of the illegal evictions - thank you for taking action. But I urge you to do more. Israel continues to abuse Palestinians’ rights with no consequence.
Thank you for making a statement condemning Israel’s ethnic cleansing. This was an important step. But I know Canada can do more.
I notice that you’re a member of the Canada-Palestinian Parliamentary Friendship Group, which released a statement imploring Canada to stop ignoring multiple violations of Palestinian human rights by the Israeli government. I thank you for taking action and I wonder what else this group can do to pressure for change.
