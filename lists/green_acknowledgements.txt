I appreciate that you’ve signed a pledge to oppose Israel’s illegal annexations. But Canada can do more. I implore you to take further action to redress the violation of Palestinian human rights.
Thank you for opposing Israel’s unlawful annexations. I urge you to do more. Israel continues to illegally attack innocent Palestinian civilians.
I know that you’ve made a statement expressing disapproval of the illegal evictions - thank you for taking action. But I urge you to do more. Israel continues to abuse Palestinians’ rights.
