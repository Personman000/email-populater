I care about this because the commitment to safeguard human rights is one of the reasons I’m proud to be a Canadian.
As a Muslim and a Canadian, it is my duty to speak up against oppression and injustice.
Every day, I have been watching the events unfold in Palestine with a heavy heart and increasing horror. I look at my family and kids and can’t imagine standing by and doing nothing if they were being hurt the same way that Palestinian children are being persecuted, traumatized, and killed. I am moved to do something, and I hope you can be too.
I work as a social service provider and everyday I witness how systemic oppression, here and abroad, hurts the people I serve. I cannot standby without doing my part.
I vote because I believe political participation is key to making a better world. That is also why I believe we all need to do our part to condemn Israel’s illegal forced evictions and murders of Palestinians.
I often remind myself that as a settler in Canada (Turtle Island), I need to do my part to condemn colonial acts when I see them. This includes occupation, apartheid, illegal forced evictions, and ethnic cleansing.
