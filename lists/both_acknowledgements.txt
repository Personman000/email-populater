I appreciate that you have publicly shown disapproval of the violation of Palestinian rights in the past, but some of your actions indicate or complicity support Israel’s apartheid, and I must urge you to do much more to rectify this.
I appreciate that you’ve taken some action to condemn Israel’s illegal actions. But as a member of the Canada-Israel Interparliamentary Group, you must do much more. I ask you to make this a priority agenda item at your next meeting.
Thank you for taking some action to condemn Israel’s illegal policies, but as a member of the Canada-Israel Interparliamentary Group, you must do more. This group is complicit in Israel’s apartheid and ethnic cleansing. To show that you are serious about ceasing the illegal human rights abuses against Palestinians, I ask you to leave this group.
Thank you for your statement and concern for the loss of lives on both sides of this conflict. However, you must do more to reflect the reality of this asymmetrical conflict. There is a clear imbalance of power, with more Palestinians being murdered through a system of oppression and apartheid. As my representative member of parliament, I am asking you to do more than what you have done thus far.
