I am deeply concerned about Israel’s ongoing human rights violations against innocent Palestinians.
I cannot accept Canada’s failure to act on Israel’s human rights abuses in Sheikh Jarrah and Gaza.
It’s difficult to be a proud Canadian right now. Contrary to Canada’s international reputation as a peacekeeping nation, we are failing the Palestinian people.
The purpose of this email is to bring light to the ongoing injustice in Palestine at the hands of the Israeli authorities.
As a Canadian citizen, the ongoing violence against Palestinians goes against my belief in fairness and justice.
