In the past few weeks, we have seen an intensified onslaught of violence in Palestine. This includesthe illegal dispossession of homes in Sheikh Jarrah, airstrikes, violent attacks on innocent civilians in Gaza and East Jerusalem, and raids on one of Islam’s holiest sites, Al-Aqsa, during one of the holiest times of the year for Muslims, Ramadan. As of May 22nd, 248 Palestinians have been murdered, with more than 1900 people wounded, including children, medics, and journalists. Israel’s actions amount to a violation of international law, as identified in this year’s Human Rights Watch Report. Israel is guilty of apartheid policies, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. The ceasefire that has been agreed upon is not enough to rectify this. Recent events are part of an ongoing system of oppression. Israel’s actions are contrary to Canada’s foreign policy and humanitarian beliefs.
