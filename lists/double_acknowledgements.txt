I appreciate that you’ve taken some action to condemn Israel’s illegal actions. As a member of the Canada-Israel Interparliamentary Group, you can do much more. I ask you to make this a priority agenda item at your next meeting.
Thank you for taking some action to condemn Israel’s illegal actions. As a member of the Canada-Israel Interparliamentary Group, you must do more. This group is complicit in Israel’s apartheid and ethnic cleansing. To show that you are serious about ceasing the illegal human rights abuses against Palestinians, I ask you to leave this group.
