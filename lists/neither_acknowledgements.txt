As you are a member of the Liberal Party, I urge you to demand better from your party leader. While the Liberals express support for a two-state solution, they have a clear track record for voting with Israel against UN resolutions that are based in international law. This issue is important to me and come election season, I will be paying attention to Liberals’ stance and actions to rectify these human rights abuses and if they have taken concrete action to pressure Israel until they comply with international law.
As you are a member of the Conservative Party, I urge you to demand better from your party leader. The Conservative Party largely refuses to criticize Israel for its illegal policies and prioritizes Israel’s security over Palestinian human rights. This issue is important to me and come election season, I will be paying attention to whether Conservatives have condemned Israel for its violation of international law.
As you are a member of the New Democratic Party, I urge you to do more to pressure our elected government to take concrete action. Israel needs to be pressured to stop its violations of international law.
As you are a member of the Green Party, I urge you to do more to pressure our elected government to take concrete action. Israel needs to be pressured to stop its violations of international law.
As you are a member of Bloc Québécois, I urge you to do more to pressure our elected government to take concrete action. Israel needs to be pressured to stop its violations of international law.
