I am deeply concerned about Israel’s recent human rights violations against Palestinians.
I cannot accept Canada’s failure to act on Israel’s human rights abuses in Sheikh Jarrah and Gaza.
It’s difficult to be a proud Canadian right now. Not when we are failing to condemn Israel’s clear violations of Palestinian rights.
I am writing to you with the purpose of addressing the ongoing human rights violations against the Palestenian population by the Israeli authorities.
The purpose of this email is to bring to light the ongoing injustice in Palestine at the hands of the Israeli authorities
As a Canadian, the ongoing violence against Palestenian citizens goes against my beliefs in fairness and justice.
